# ChatlettiClientDroidscript
This is the client side of Chatletti messenger. The client is written entirely with droidscript. In the future, the application will be finalized by me. Currently, messaging with another user via the server is supported. There is no authorization function yet and encryption is not fully configured, multithreading is not supported
